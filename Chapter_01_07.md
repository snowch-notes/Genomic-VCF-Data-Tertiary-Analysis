**1.7. Estimating Current and Future VCF Data Volumes in Europe**

Understanding the scale of genomic data in Europe is crucial for appreciating the challenges of tertiary analysis. While exact figures are difficult to obtain due to data privacy and varying research practices, we can make reasonable estimations based on available information, encompassing both current and projected volumes.

* **Current Data Generation:**
    * Europe has a growing repository of genomic data from diverse sources:
        * **Research Initiatives:** Large-scale projects like those contributing to the European Genome-phenome Archive (EGA) have generated significant datasets. The EGA itself hosts a very large amount of genomic data. Looking at the EGA datasets, there are many studies that contain 1000's of samples, and some that contain 10's of thousands.
        * **National Biobanks:** Countries across Europe have established biobanks, such as the UK Biobank, which holds genomic data from hundreds of thousands of participants. These biobanks contribute substantial amounts of VCF and related data.
        * **Clinical Sequencing:** The increasing use of genomic sequencing in clinical diagnostics and personalized medicine is generating a steady flow of VCF data.
    * To get a rough estimate:
        * Considering that several European biobanks and research cohorts already contain genomic data from hundreds of thousands of individuals.
        * Taking into account that clinical sequencing is becoming more common.
        * It is reasonable to estimate that the current accumulated VCF data in Europe is likely within the range of tens of Petabytes. This is a conservative estimate, and the real value could be higher.
    * It is also very important to remember that Genotype array data is also very prevalent, and that it also creates very large data sets.

* **Factors Driving Future Growth:**
    * "1+ Million Genomes" Initiative: This initiative aims to sequence and analyze at least 1 million genomes across Europe, significantly increasing data volumes.
    * National Healthcare Integration: Increasing integration of genomics into national healthcare systems will lead to routine clinical sequencing, generating vast amounts of data.
    * Research Advancements: Ongoing research in areas like cancer genomics, rare diseases, and pharmacogenomics will continue to produce large datasets.
    * Decreasing Sequencing Costs: The decreasing cost of sequencing will make it more accessible, further accelerating data generation.
    * Population Genomics: Large scale population studies.
    * Pan-European Biobanks: the linking of biobanks across Europe will create very large data sets.

* **Future Volume Projections:**
    * Near-term (5 years): With the "1+ Million Genomes" initiative and increased clinical sequencing, we can expect the total VCF data volume to grow to hundreds of petabytes.
    * Long-term (10+ years): If genomics becomes a routine part of healthcare, with a significant portion of the European population having their genomes sequenced, the data volume could reach exabyte scales.
    * Considering the growth of other forms of genomic data, the total amount of data to be stored and analysed, will likely exceed the VCF data amounts.

* **Implications:**
    * The rapid growth of genomic data highlights the urgent need for scalable and efficient data management solutions.
    * Traditional database systems are unlikely to cope with these data volumes, emphasizing the importance of specialized databases like VAST DB.
    * Data compression, optimized storage, and high-performance computing are essential for managing and analyzing these datasets.
    * Data security and privacy are paramount concerns, requiring robust access control and data protection measures.
    * The ability to perform federated analysis across multiple data sets will be increasingly important.
