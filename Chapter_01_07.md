**1.7. Estimating Current and Future VCF Data Volumes in Europe**

Understanding the scale of genomic data in Europe is crucial for appreciating the challenges of tertiary analysis. While exact figures are difficult to obtain due to data privacy and varying research practices, we can make reasonable estimations based on available information, encompassing both current and projected volumes.

* **Current Data Generation:**
    * Europe has a substantial existing base of genomic data from various research projects, national biobanks, and clinical sequencing.
    * Current estimates suggest that several hundred thousand to a few million individuals across Europe have undergone some form of genomic sequencing (WGS, WES, targeted panels).
    * Considering a conservative average of 10 GB per WGS VCF and proportionally smaller sizes for WES and targeted panels, the current accumulated VCF data volume is likely in the range of tens of petabytes.
    * It is important to remember that there is also a large amount of array based genotyping data, that while not VCF, is also used in genomic research.

* **Factors Driving Future Growth:**
    * **"1+ Million Genomes" Initiative:** This initiative aims to sequence and analyze at least 1 million genomes across Europe, significantly increasing data volumes.
    * **National Healthcare Integration:** Increasing integration of genomics into national healthcare systems will lead to routine clinical sequencing, generating vast amounts of data.
    * **Research Advancements:** Ongoing research in areas like cancer genomics, rare diseases, and pharmacogenomics will continue to produce large datasets.
    * **Decreasing Sequencing Costs:** The decreasing cost of sequencing will make it more accessible, further accelerating data generation.
    * **Population Genomics:** Large scale population studies.
    * **Pan-European Biobanks:** the linking of biobanks across Europe will create very large data sets.

* **Future Volume Projections:**
    * **Near-term (5 years):** With the "1+ Million Genomes" initiative and increased clinical sequencing, we can expect the total VCF data volume to grow to hundreds of petabytes.
    * **Long-term (10+ years):** If genomics becomes a routine part of healthcare, with a significant portion of the European population having their genomes sequenced, the data volume could reach exabyte scales.
    * Considering the growth of other forms of genomic data, the total amount of data to be stored and analysed, will likely exceed the VCF data amounts.

* **Implications:**
    * The rapid growth of genomic data highlights the urgent need for scalable and efficient data management solutions.
    * Traditional database systems are unlikely to cope with these data volumes, emphasizing the importance of specialized databases like VAST DB.
    * Data compression, optimized storage, and high-performance computing are essential for managing and analyzing these datasets.
    * Data security and privacy are paramount concerns, requiring robust access control and data protection measures.
    * The ability to perform federated analysis across multiple data sets will be increasingly important.
