# Genetic Variants

Genetic variants are differences in the DNA sequence among individuals. These differences can affect how individuals look, how their bodies function, and their susceptibility to diseases.

## Types of Genetic Variants

1. **Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)**:
    - These are the most common type of genetic variation. A SNP represents a difference in a single DNA building block, called a nucleotide.
    - For example, a SNP might change the DNA sequence AAGGCTAA to AAGGCTGA.

2. **Insertions and Deletions (Indels)**:
    - These involve the addition or loss of small segments of DNA. Insertions add one or more nucleotides into the DNA sequence, while deletions remove one or more nucleotides.
    - For example, an insertion might change the DNA sequence AAGGCTAA to AAGGCGTAA, and a deletion might change it to AAGCTAA.

3. **Copy Number Variations (CNVs)**:
    - These are larger segments of DNA that are duplicated or deleted. CNVs can affect a large number of genes and have a significant impact on an individual's health and development.

4. **Structural Variants**:
    - These are larger changes in the structure of chromosomes, such as inversions (a segment of DNA reversed within the chromosome), translocations (segments of DNA that have been moved from one location to another), and large duplications or deletions.

5. **Microsatellites (Short Tandem Repeats - STRs)**:
    - These are repeating sequences of 2-5 base pairs of DNA. The number of repeats can vary among individuals, making them useful for genetic fingerprinting.

6. **Rare Variants**:
    - These are genetic variations that occur infrequently in the population. They might be unique to an individual or family and can sometimes have significant effects on health.

Understanding genetic variants is crucial for fields like genetics, medicine, and evolutionary biology. They help scientists understand the genetic basis of diseases, develop new treatments, and trace human ancestry.
